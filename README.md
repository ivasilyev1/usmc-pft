## Description

This project intends to provide a simple and intuitive means of calculating scores for the Marine Corpsâ€™ Physical Fitness Test and Combat Fitness Test events.

Support is included for all events that are currently authorized:

- Physical Fitness Test
  - Three Mile Run / Five Km Row
  - Pullups / Pushups
  - Crunches / Plank
- Combat Fitness Test
  - Movement to Contact
  - Maneuver Under Fire
  - Ammo Can Lifts

Simply enter the event time or number of repetitions and your score is calculated depicting the:

- Total Points Earned / Total Points Possible, for each event (ie: xxx/100 or xxx/70)
- Overall Total Points (ie: xxx/300)
- PFT/CFT Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or Fail)

The application is also responsive and should display well on mobile devices:

## Is this an official application?

No, this is not an official Marine Corps application, nor is it endorsed by the Marine Corps or an other government entity. It is a hobby project/website and purely serves as a convenience to calculate scores when access to the official calculator is impractical (ie: on a mobile device after running the events).

All necessary data and documentation required to calculate scores is publicly available and [published online](https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/2052205/mco-610013a-wch-2/).
